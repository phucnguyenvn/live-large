00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,133

2
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:25,567
[music]

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,734
Tôi luôn nói với mọi người về
tâm lý của một vận động viên thể hình,

4
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:31,734
Họ buộc phải có--một thứ gì đó
thôi thúc bên trong họ.

5
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,567
Họ không thể bình thường.

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,133
[music]

7
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:40,433
Họ không bao giờ thỏa mãn
với hiện tại

8
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,100
vì họ luôn luôn muốn bản thân
tốt hơn.

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,233
Họ luôn muốn một hình thể đẹp hơn
hiện tại.

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,867
Họ bắt buộc phải đẩy bản thân
liên tục vượt qua giới hạn.

11
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:51,867
Một số người có cơ địa tiềm tàng
trở thành người có hình thể đẹp nhất trên thế giới

12
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:54,266
nhưng họ không có đủ sự kiên quyết

13
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,633
để đạt được điều đó.

14
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:04,934
Thật sự mà nói, thì bạn phải..
Tôi nghĩ là, phải có một chút điên.

15
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:17,934
[music]

16
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,100
Bạn sẽ không hiểu
lợi thế để là một người bình thường

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,166
cho đến khi bạn nhìn vào ai đó như tôi,
người không thể mặc được những bộ quần áo bình thường

18
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:32,433
không thể ăn những thức ăn người thường,
không thể lái một chiếc xe có kích thước của người thường,

19
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,300
Không thể ngồi ghế có kích cỡ phổ thông khi lên máy bay

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,367
đi nước ngoài và cố ngủ
trên một cái giường khách sạn nhỏ xíu

21
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,266
cố gắng ngồi lọt vào cái bồn tắm nhỏ xíu trong khách sạn

22
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,433
Rất khó để đi ra ngoài ăn uống
và mua sắm như người bình thường

23
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,000
Rất khó để đi du lịch.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,900
So I mean, when
you're 290 pounds,

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,867
it's very difficult
to do a lot of things.

26
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,467
You know, you're so abnormal, I
mean, as compared to what people

27
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,300
are used to seeing, people laugh
'cause they just never see

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
anyone so huge, you know.

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,967
It's hard to hide it.

30
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,433
And I'm, you know, I don't
wear big baggy clothes.

31
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:13,367
A lot of times, I wear more
form-fitting stuff and,

32
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:20,900
you know, people don't--
it's not the norm.

33
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,166
You have certain places where
you grow up and you're like,

34
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,467
"I want to be there."

35
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,667
I mean, this is one
of those places.

36
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,400
I came to Vegas for
the first time in '97.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,133
I fell in love
with it, you know?

38
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,767
And that was before it was built
up even the way it is now.

39
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:41,934
But what other place can you go
and 24 hours a day you just wake

40
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,433
up and decide I want to go do
this or I want to go do that?

41
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,600
Like, I want to eat.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,934
I want to go work out.

43
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,433
I want to go see
a movie, you know,

44
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:53,066
I want to go to the supermarket.

45
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,767
I want to go eat at this
restaurant, you know?

46
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,767
It's just--you can do anything
you want, pretty much.

47
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,033
You can have sushi
'til 6 in the morning.

48
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:03,800
I don't know any place in
the world really that does that

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,367
you know, on a consistent basis
that you can do that stuff.

50
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,166
I like the fast tempo of Vegas.

51
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,934
I couldn't live in
a slow environment.

52
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,734
People always ask me, "Are you
ever gonna move back to--"

53
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:16,300
I could never go back to
the slow pace, you know?

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,967
People ask me, "How do you
train and focus in Vegas

55
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,800
when there's so many outside
things pulling at you?"

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,667
And I think that I thrive on
that, I love to be able to know

57
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,500
that most people can't do that.

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I mean, I love to be able to
have that at my fingertips

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,567
even though I never take
advantage of it.

60
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,834
It gives me more drive, being
in a place that's so actively

61
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:43,500
just crazy and I'm still
so focused on what I do.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,900
It's kind of like the opposite
thinking a little bit, you know?

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,600
Here we are.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
What's up, guys?

65
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,567
What up?

66
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,867
What's going on, man?

67
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,767
All right, pull ups.

68
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,300
Shirts off.

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,000
Kelly, you're getting
all swelled up.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,467
Got to do something
for the Olympia.

71
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:27,333
Got to put Bodybuilding.com
in the back of my head.

72
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,934
Jay Cutler, trainer.

73
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,934
Yeah, it's been over
a couple some months.

74
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,266
So we're taking
it down again?

75
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,667
Just like we did last time?

76
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,066
Yeah, and you've got
to shave my face too.

77
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,133
Keep it tight?

78
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,467
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,800
Just a little tight, you know.

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,767
Tight at the bottom,
nice and clean, like.

81
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,266
Like a taper, right?

82
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:52,533
You know, I find myself
nowadays I don't even touch

83
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,266
my hair in the morning.

84
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,200
I get up.

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,834
That's what my hair looks like.

86
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:01,834
Then I jump in the pool.

87
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,667
Traveling and being Jay Cutler, it's not an easy thing.

88
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,033
Everywhere you go, you're
noticed and, of course,

89
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,033
you're in demand.

90
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,500
People say, "What do
you do for a living?"

91
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,166
I said, "I eat, sleep,
and train and that's it."

92
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,834
I kind of joke like that because
it does seem like that a lot of

93
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,066
times but there is some
fun built in there.

94
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:22,667
But I never looked at myself and
said, "I'm so obsessed," because

95
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,700
I always seem to have some sort
of balance in there and I always

96
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,133
realized that this is a career
and, obviously, if you go at it

97
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,100
full tilt all the time, you're
gonna burn yourself down so you

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,200
have to set a certain
pace for yourself.

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
To the point where you're
continually moving forward

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,266
and being great.

101
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:42,000
Very good or you want
something else on top?

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,867
No, that's good, right.

103
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:44,667
It's good.

104
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,533
Want some gel?

105
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,667
No, no, no.

106
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:50,867
I'm gonna take a
shower and clean up.

107
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:56,000
The Olympic chair.

108
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:02,900
Larry, I need your help.

109
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,567
What's going on with the shirts?

110
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,033
I just called
Kevin, actually.

111
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,734
So he is gonna call me back.

112
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,000
Everything should
be done this week.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,767
I know, but "this
week" meaning what?

114
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,834
Tomorrow,
Wednesday the latest.

115
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,266
I would, honestly, I
believe they're done.

116
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,100
Usually, like, I
show up at, like--

117
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,500
When he wants to.

118
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,367
Between--no, 9 and 10.

119
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,433
When he wants to show up.

120
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,333
Nine and ten.

121
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,066
I don't--

122
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,133
It depends if he goes
out the night before.

123
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,333
No, I don't even
go out anymore.

124
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,633
I just work at night, that's it.

125
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,767
Every day it's
different, you know?

126
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,033
I say, "Pay this bill."

127
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,333
Okay, you've got to call these
people and, you know, it's,

128
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,667
literally I sit in the kitchen
and I scream to him,

129
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:39,133
"Hey," you know, "do
this, do that," you know?

130
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,700
So he's trying to do a job that
probably takes three or four

131
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,433
people and, for a 21-year-old
kid to be able to do that,

132
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,000
like, I mean, it takes
a lot of his time.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,633
He works 6 days a week at
least, you know, sometimes 7.

134
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,100
You know, when you think
you've seen someone work hard,

135
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,834
like, "Oh, man, he works hard."

136
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:58,433
And then you meet someone like
Jay and you're like,

137
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,867
"This is a whole
'nother ball game."

138
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,967
You know, it's not like we're
operating a huge operation

139
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:02,834
over here.

140
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,367
I mean, running out of my house
and my garage and, yes, there's

141
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,533
a lot of space but, you know, we
have day-to-day things that we

142
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,000
need to get done and I'm
only home on certain times.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,967
I traveled this year extensively
and we had 1 or 2 days to get

144
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:20,900
stuff done when I was home and
we rely on other people and it's

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,433
impossible to do that so
we try to do everything,

146
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,467
you know, on our own.

147
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,533
What did I overnight that?

148
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,200
I never overnight anything.

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I know you like
to spend money, dude.

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,967
I see how much it cost.

151
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,300
It cost 35 bucks to
send a damn poster.

152
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,500
No, it doesn't.

153
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
What are you talking--

154
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,133
It cost you 35 bucks
to have one poster cost.

155
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,166
No, it didn't.

156
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,166
I saw it.

157
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,300
Did I not see it?

158
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,233
I saw it.

159
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,433
No it didn't cost me $35.

160
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:44,433
I'll show you right now.

161
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,734
What did I say about
that poster that day?

162
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,934
Don't lie.

163
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,834
Yeah, I did see
that it said that.

164
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, you said that
I have no choice.

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,100
That's what they choose.

166
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,000
Whoa.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,233
What day--was it a
poster in a large box?

168
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,600
No, it's a poster.

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,333
By itself?

170
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:57,934
Yes.

171
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:58,667
And it cost $35?

172
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes.

173
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,633
Okay, I'll pull it up right
now and if it's $35,

174
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,066
then you can have my check.

175
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,367
You can have my whole check.

176
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,834
It's gonna come
out of your pay.

177
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,900
Don't start, Monique.

178
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,600
I'm in a bad mood that even
Larry said I came out in

179
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,633
a bad mood this morning.

180
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:20,467
And that's the thing, you run
with the crew and there's time

181
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,500
when we play and there's
time when we work.

182
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,667
And this is all business now.

183
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:28,100
I mean, this is--I admit
half my life is play time,

184
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,633
three-quarters of my life is
play time but when it comes down

185
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:34,500
to get the business and
the business is now, I mean,

186
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:43,166
there's no--we have
no time for fun.

187
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:53,734
You know, I've been
a four-time champ, you know,

188
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,266
and I've been 6-time runner-up

189
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:00,867
and I'm the greatest
bodybuilder ever.

190
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,200
There's no question.

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,934
I feel that I'm the greatest.

192
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:15,033
I still want to compete at my
best even at the age I'm at and,

193
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,100
you know, people say
"past your prime."

194
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,467
I mean, I don't know if
there's any past your prime.

195
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,700
When I'm still competitive you
don't want to think about that.

196
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,467
You're not gonna go and do a
show and say, "Well, I'm past my

197
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,433
prime, I'm just doing it for
the, you know, just to stand up

198
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,200
there."

199
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,734
That's not how an athlete or a
champion bodybuilder, you know,

200
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,000
trains for a
competition or things.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,367
They always want to think about
winning and being the absolute

202
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,567
best.

203
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:51,567
[music]

204
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,066
There is no
failure at this point.

205
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,700
I mean, I've done it all.

206
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,467
There's never gonna be a day
that passes that I'm gonna step

207
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,533
out and people are gonna--aren't
gonna know who Jay Cutler is.

208
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:13,300
I don't see it ever happening.

209
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,834
Ron, what's up?

210
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh, no...

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,266
I'm back in Vegas for the week
and I think Dave's coming

212
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,100
next--this coming weekend.

213
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,266
He's gonna shoot some training
stuff and then I shoot with

214
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,100
Bernell next week, I
think, for some features.

215
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,367
Hey, what's the name of that
pizza place next to Kyzen?

216
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,700
I like more lounge-type
places like Hyde Lounge

217
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,133
at Bellagio.

218
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,033
Monique?

219
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,667
Or Tryst at the Wynn.

220
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,400
No, I don't go to strip clubs.

221
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
I got a stripper
pole in my bedroom,

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't need strip clubs.

223
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,100
[music]

224
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,667
You know, when you
have, like, you know,

225
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,133
30-something-inch thighs
and you've got, you know,

226
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:07,033
22-1/2-inch arms and you've
got a 19-inch neck and a broad

227
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,400
shoulder, it's difficult to find
things other than tank tops

228
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,767
and shorts.

229
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:12,900
Everything's custom.

230
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,533
I mean, I can't fit
into normal sleeves.

231
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,700
Obviously, the dress shirts are
tailored, you know, like,

232
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,767
the button-up shirts.

233
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,567
My suit jackets, I think, are 58
or 60 or something like that.

234
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:26,400
I mean, it's crazy.

235
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,700
If you look at what's
considered an ideal drop

236
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,600
to a manufacturer of suits,
it's a 6-inch drop.

237
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,734
That's the difference between
your chest and your waist.

238
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,767
I've got some guys that, you
know, are fairly serious

239
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,734
bodybuilders and they've
got a 10-inch drop.

240
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,433
And Jay has 20.

241
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:56,367
It kind of defies the physics of
what you can do with fabric,

242
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:01,533
you know, in a constructed sense
to go from here to here.

243
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:04,333
Right, Jay, you
ready to go to work?

244
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,300
I won't stop
and tell you now.

245
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,433
I'll remember.

246
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,834
Okay.

247
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:13,500
Fifty-four and you
were fifty-seven.

248
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,633
That's a big difference.

249
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,834
Feet together.

250
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,200
Wow, that's about
5 inches less, Jay.

251
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,734
That's pretty serious.

252
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:25,500
I won my first Olympia
heavier than I weigh right now.

253
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,400
I was competing against
Ronnie, you know, at 273.

254
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,367
I mean, when I came back
and won in 2009 I was 254.

255
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,033
It's all illusion, you know?

256
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,200
Thirty-seven.

257
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,300
Actual thigh, twenty-nine.

258
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
Nineteen.

259
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,333
Go ahead and flex.

260
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,000
Twenty-one-and-a-half.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,233
You've lost a lot of weight
so we're gonna be doing

262
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:54,133
some different things here.

263
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:09,233
This thing'll be full
by the end of the day.

264
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,900
Yeah, it's hard to hide it.

265
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,200
You know, that's the one thing
about being a professional

266
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,100
bodybuilder, is where other
people can hide, you know,

267
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,400
athletes, unless they're,
like, real, real famous faces.

268
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,166
You just can't
hide the physique.

269
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,333
I mean, and the thing is is,
like, you know, a lot of

270
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,834
bodybuilders change from
on-season to off-season.

271
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,467
Like, I don't
change a whole lot.

272
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,867
I'm pretty much visible.

273
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:32,266
The hair's the same, the face
stays the same, you know?

274
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:35,300
And you know, I'm a unique look
for a lot of the bodybuilders,

275
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,533
you know?

276
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,333
You know, there's not a lot of
huge, you know, big, blond,

277
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,433
white guys, you know?

278
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,667
Oh, look at all those zits.

279
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:52,467
I'm gonna pop 'em after.

280
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,367
How bad has it
grown in now.

281
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,767
My God.

282
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,800
Bad?

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,533
You're like a Chia pet.

284
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,867
You know, I never had hair on
my back until I started shaving,

285
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:09,900
you know that?

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,533
When I got ready for my first
show when I was 18, it's like

287
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:15,900
when I started shaving my back,
it's like I turned into

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,200
a gorilla.

289
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,100
Larry told me to do Nair.

290
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,967
Less fuss.

291
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,367
I'm gonna tell him he
has to shave my armpits.

292
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,767
Yeah [laughing]

293
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,367
Hey, Larry!

294
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,200
I need your help.

295
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Larry!

296
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,166
Dude, I need you to
shave my armpits.

297
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,400
Oh, no.

298
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,700
God, you're good, she's good.

299
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
You sure?

300
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,400
Yeah.

301
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,500
No, look at my armpits.

302
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
There's nothing in there.

303
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,433
And my lower
back, you did too?

304
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:49,867
You know, when you're my size
you never think you're small.

305
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,533
Like, I like the way I look now.

306
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,834
You know, I'm always in decent
shape and I always check myself

307
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,066
out.

308
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,000
I never look at my face though.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,967
I mostly look at the physique,
you know, and flex the abs and,

310
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:04,200
ha, ha.

311
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:18,800
Ah, ah, right there.

312
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,433
As you've seen
the progression in almost

313
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,700
50 years of bodybuilding in
the Mr. Olympia Competition,

314
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,633
you know, we saw the days of
Arnold where they weren't so

315
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,633
conditioned or so big and
nowadays, I mean, the guys are

316
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:44,800
so big, they're so conditioned.

317
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,567
There's so many variables and
bodybuilding has become so

318
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:50,400
scientific and trying to tune
the body into, you know,

319
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,433
show the best conditioning
with the most size.

320
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,700
Ah, am I getting too big?

321
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,200
You know, bodies aren't made
to be as strong as I guess that

322
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,834
Mr. Olympia competitors become.

323
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:28,066
[rifle firing]

324
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:35,667
[laughing]

325
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:39,667
[music]

326
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,900
Jay, man, I'm gonna give you
a safety briefing before we

327
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,133
go on the range.

328
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,333
We're gonna treat every gun as
if it's loaded at all times,

329
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,500
even if you know it's unloaded.

330
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,333
Always keep your trigger finger
off the trigger 'til you're on

331
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,700
target and ready to fire.

332
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,033
And always keep the gun
pointed in a safe direction.

333
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,233
Pretty crazy.

334
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,433
If at any time, you hear
someone call out, "Cease fire,"

335
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,567
please stop shooting.

336
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,533
Take your finger off
the trigger, put the gun down

337
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,300
on the counter and step
back away from it.

338
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,900
Put your body weight forward.

339
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
It helps you to
absorb the recoil.

340
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,567
[rifle firing]

341
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,066
You're a gangster.

342
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:15,066
I know.

343
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:18,233
Single shot, full auto.

344
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,900
[rifle firing]

345
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,800
[pistol firing]

346
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:43,367
You can never teach
anyone training advice.

347
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,000
It's always the business.

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,900
'Cause everyone wants
to make the money.

349
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,567
They want to be a superstar
and look like a superstar.

350
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,767
The magazines expose you as
a superstar because you're

351
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:57,400
featured with the muscles
and the look, you know,

352
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
but financially they
want the back-up of that

353
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,033
and that's what I have.

354
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,800
I have all the tools to create
that and a lot of people have

355
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,834
come to me for that opportunity.

356
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah, we may stumble but we
always land higher and

357
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,967
get to where we need to be.

358
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:23,567
Even when I was smaller, I hate
to say small but I'd look at

359
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:27,800
these guys and still say, "I'm
still the best and still

360
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,467
the greatest and still th6e
biggest name in bodybuilding."

361
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,734
Stack 'em is the show.

362
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,400
Come on.

363
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,033
Let's go, Jay, come on.

364
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:46,867
Suck it up, suck it up,
suck it up, suck it up.

365
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:49,333
Mentally, you have to be,
I think, a little crazy.

366
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,767
People approach me and they
say, "Jay, what's the secret?

367
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,667
What's the secret?
What's the secret?"

368
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,967
I don't like to eat anything.

369
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,633
If you ask me what
my favorite food is,

370
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't have a favorite food.

371
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,900
I don't look forward
to any meal at all.

372
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
You're a living legend,

373
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,567
that's what's amazing
about what I do.

374
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,200
Jay Cutler!

375
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,300
And I tell you, Jay Cutler's
the greatest of all time.
